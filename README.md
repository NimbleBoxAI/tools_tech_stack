Tools and tech stack for deep learning on windows

## Steps
1. Go [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and download the anaconda installer for windows and place it in the same folder as the script and rename it to **Anaconda3.exe**

2. Open powershell as **admin** and go through the below commands to setup the tools.

 ```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
./anaconda_install.ps1
```

3. Now close powershell and open it once again with **admin** permissions (conda is not registered as a command right after you installed it and so we need a fresh environment for powershell that has conda registered as a command).

```powershell
./env_prepare.ps1
Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted
```
