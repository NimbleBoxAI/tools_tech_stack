# tools_tech_stack
Tools and tech stack for deep learning on windows

## Steps
### Prerequisites
1. Clone or download this repository.

if using `git`:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NimbleBoxAI/tools_tech_stack.git
```
otherwise you can just press on the `code` button and download the zip.

2. Download the below listed tools from the given links and put them into the download repository and rename them as pointed below.

| Tools          | Renamed setup files    |
| -------------- | -------------------    |
| VSCode         | Anaconda3.exe          |
| Anaconda3      | VSCodeSetup.exe        |
| Github Desktop | GitHubDesktopSetup.exe |

3. Open **cmd** (Command prompt) as **admin** and go through the below commands to setup the tools.

 ```cmd
tool_installer.cmd
```

4. Now close **cmd** and open it once again with **admin** permissions (conda is not registered as a command right after you installed it and so we need a fresh environment for cmd that has conda registered as a command).

```cmd
env_prep.cmd
```

5. Just write `conda activate deep_learning` in cmd to use the environment.

### Tools installed by the `tool_installer.cmd` script

1. VSCode
2. Anaconda3

### Tools installed by the `env_prep.cmd` script

1. Nbox
2. Torch
3. Tensorflow
4. Scikit-learn
5. Pandas
6. Numpy
7. Nltk
8. Opencv-python
9. Openvino-dev
10. Transformers
11. Torchvision

## nbox

Nbox is a library that makes using a host of models provided by the opensource community a lot more easier be it computer vision, NLP or machine learning, I have listed some of it's abilities down below.
