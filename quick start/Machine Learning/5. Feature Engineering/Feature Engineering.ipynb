Algorithms require features with some specific characteristic to work properly. Hence a need for feature engineering arises. Feature engineering efforts mainly have two goals:\n",

    "- Improving the performance of machine learning models.\n",

Some techniques might work better with some algorithms or datasets, while some of them might be beneficial in all cases. The best way to achieve expertise in feature engineering is practicing different techniques on various datasets and observing their effect on model performances.\n",
